# Bible and Quran Verse Generator
This program will pick a random verse from the Bible and Quran and generate an image with the text from both on it, side by side.

## Why
I'll be honest, I hardly know what's in either one of these texts and I've heard a lot of opinions from people who I don't think have read either one thoroughly either. I want to put them side by side and see if maybe they're not so different from each other after all.

I was inspired by watching the video "The Holy Quran Experiment" on YouTube - [Link Here](https://youtu.be/zEnWw_lH4tQ)
